# Release Notes for 2020.04

This release includes major changes compared previous Freedom Unleashed SDK and thus is **experimental** at this stage. Main changes include:

- All layers (openembedded-core, meta-openembedded, meta-riscv) updated to their latest revisions

- Kernel updated to v5.6.2

- GCC updated to 9.3.0

- Added back 3 packages removed in 2020.03.00 due to Python 3 migration (two Xfce4 packages and fio)

- ATI drivers updated (for HD6450 and similar GPUs)

- AMD drivers added (tested with RX550 and RX570, POLARIS GPUs)

- Glamor (2D acceleration using GPU) enabled (tested with HD6450 and RX550, no artifacts)

- Wayland distribution feature disabled as we use X11

- LLVM updated to 10.0.0 (final release, only used by Mesa for GPUs)

- Mesa updated to 20.0.3

- Vulkan enabled for AMD GPUs (tested with RX550)

- spidev driver enabled

- Disk images no more include debug packages by default and thus there is less to download

- Separate disk image with debug packages can be built by adding `-debug` prefix to the build target (e.g. `demo-coreip-cli-debug` or `demo-coreip-xfce4-debug`)

- Notable new packages added: libgpiod, libgpiod-tools, libgpiod-dev, i2c-tools, spitools, glibc-utils, libgomp-dev.

## Known Issues

1. Avoid overclocking SoC using CPUFreq if you are using HiFive Unleashed Expansion Board from Microsemi as this will hang the board. Hard reset will be required.

2. If Xfce4 desktop disk image is used with HiFive Unleashed Expansion Board and GPU then rebooting is required after the 1st boot.
