# Release Notes for 2021.02

This release includes major changes compared previous Freedom Unleashed SDK and thus is **experimental** at this stage. The main changes include:

- All layers (openembedded-core, meta-openemedded, meta-riscv, meta-clang) were __not__ updated from the previous (2021.01) release.

- Added new MACHINE ("unmatched") for HiFive Unmatched board.
	+ __Note:__ Contact your SiFive representative before using disk images built for `unmatched` machine on your particular board. This particular releases targets pre-production 8GB RAM Unmatched board.

- By default disabled NFS systemd units (should only be enabled by the user if configured).

- By default disable SSH systemd units (should only be enabled by the user once the default password is changed). The following instructions would enable SSH daemon service:
 
  ```
  systemctl enable sshd.socket
  systemctl start sshd.socket
  ```

- Updated stress-ng to 0.12.03.

- Updated U-Boot to v2021.01.

- Updated OpenSBI to v0.9.

- New kernel (v5.10.17) was added for HiFive Unmatched.

## Known Issues

1. Avoid overclocking SoC using CPUFreq if you are using HiFive Unleashed Expansion Board from Microsemi as this will hang the board. Hard reset will be required.

2. If Xfce4 desktop disk image is used with HiFive Unleashed Expansion Board and GPU then rebooting is required after the 1st boot.

3. Newer OE/Yocto buildtools could cause build issues for `nspr-native` package. Use `-r yocto-3.2_M2 -t 20200729` as described in README file if you are using OE/Yocto buildtools. See Yocto bug [#14112](https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14112)

4. We have found an issue with SanDisk "A2" microSD cards and thus do not recommend them.
